<p>
Technology is the application of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"> conceptual knowledge</a> for achieving practical<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"> goals</a>, especially in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">reproducible</a> way.[1] The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,[2][3] including both tangible<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"> tools </a>such as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_utensil"> utensils</a> or<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"> machines</a>, and intangible ones such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>. Technology plays a critical role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering">engineering</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday_life">everyday life</a>.</p>

Technological advancements have led to significant changes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society">society</a>. The earliest known technology is the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_tool">stone tool</a>, used during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory">prehistoric times</a>, followed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_of_fire_by_early_humans">control of fire</a>, which contributed to the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_size"> growth </a> of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"> human brain </a> and the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language">language </a>during the<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene">Ice Age</a>. The invention of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel"> wheel </a>in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age"> Bronze Age</a> allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">printing press</a>, telephone, and the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"> Internet</a>, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy"> knowledge economy</a>.</p>

While technology contributes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development"> economic development</a> and improves human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity">prosperity</a>, it can also have negative impacts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution">pollution</a> and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_depletion"> resource depletion</a>, and can cause social harms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment">technological unemployment</a> resulting from<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"> automation</a>. As a result, there are ongoing philosophical and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_technology">political debates</a> about the role and use of technology, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_technology">ethics of technology</a>, and ways to mitigate its downsides.</p>
<h1>ETYMOLOGY</h1>
<p>
Technology is a term dating back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance">early 17th century</a> that meant 'systematic treatment' (from<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"> Greek</a> Τεχνολογία, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek">Greek</a>:<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%84%CE%AD%CF%87%CE%BD%CE%B7#English"> τέχνη</a>, <a jref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek">romanized</a>: tékhnē, lit. 'craft, art' and -λογία, 'study, knowledge').[4][5] It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne"> tékhnē</a>, used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things', which encompassed activities like architecture.[6]</p>
<p>
Starting in the 19th century, continental Europeans started using the terms Technik (German) or technique (French) to refer to a 'way of doing', which included all technical arts, such as dancing, navigation, or printing, whether or not they required tools or instruments.[7] At the time, Technologie (German and French) referred either to the academic discipline studying the "methods of arts and crafts", or to the political discipline "intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts."[8] Since the distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English, both were translated as technology. The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline, as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.[9]</p>
<p>
In the 20th century, as a result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress">scientific progress </a>and the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution"> Second Industrial Revolution</a>, technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on its current-day meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends.[10]</p>
<h1> SOCIAL MEDIA </h1>

Social media are interactive technologies that facilitate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation">creation</a>,<ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_exchange">sharing </a>and < a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator">aggregation </a>of < ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)">content</a>, ideas, interests, and other forms of expression through<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_community"> virtual communities</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_virtualization">networks</a>.[1][2] Social media refers to new forms of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)"> media </a>that involve interactive participation.
